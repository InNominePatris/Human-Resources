# Human-Resources App

This is our final project for database II subject, the teacher assigned us to develop a human resources application with some specific
modules like "contracts, social benefits, training, controls, etc...". So we decided to get into this wonderfull adventure developing a
web application written in Django-Python.

This is a collab with two great friends Idsart, CÃ©sar and Keysha. Hope this helpfully works for future developers.
